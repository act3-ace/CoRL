# 1. Core ACT3 Reinforcement Learning Library

> **This repository and corresponding documentation site are currently under construction. We are still porting items and updating instructions for GitHub.**

## 1.1. Summary

The Core ACT3 Reinforcement Learning library (CoRL) is created and maintained by the Air Force Research Laboratoryâ€™s (AFRL) [Autonomy Capability Team (ACT3)](https://www.afrl.af.mil/ACT3/). CoRL is intended to enable scalable deep reinforcement learning (RL) experimentation in a manner extensible to new simulations and new ways for the learning agents to interact with them. The objective is to make RL research easier by removing lock-in to particular simulations.

### 1.1.1. Benefits

- Makes RL environment development significantly easier
- Provides hyper configurable environments, agents and experiments
- Record observations by adding a few lines of config (instead of creating a new file for each observation)
- Reuse glues/dones/rewards between different tasks if they are general
- Uses an episode parameter provider (EPP) to randomize both domain and curriculum learning
- Has an integration first focus, which means that integrating agents to the real world or different simulators is significantly easier
